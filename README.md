- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GabrielGSBV

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=d_flagship3_profile_self_view_public_profile
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always used computers but never consider something involving technology for my degree, and look at me now studying computer science,
               and yes I learn English by myself (this explains my poor writing)
